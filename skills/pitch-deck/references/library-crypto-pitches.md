# Crypto and DePIN pitches

Twenty-nine pitches from crypto infrastructure and physical-infrastructure (DePIN) teams, 28 of
them opened (video or deck); the Solana 2018 seed is known only through a secondary account. Use
it to decide how loud the chain and the token should be in your pitch, and to prepare for the
token question that all three investor Q&As here asked.

Quotes come from auto-captions or local transcription and keep their errors (for example
"salana"). Outcomes use open sources only: 11 next round, 5 token, 2 acquired, 11 unknown.

**Chain role** is our coding of each pitch: **leads** = the chain or the token is the engine of
the pitch (supply via token, the product is the chain, buying the asset); **background** = the
pitch opens on the physical problem and the chain enters as settlement, traceability or a later
phase, or only as a team credential; **absent** = not mentioned. 16 lead, 12 background, 1 absent.

## What repeats across them

1. **Near the money, the chain steps back.** CrowdBrain's hackathon pitch says "Solana makes
   this market enforceable"; at its accelerator demo day Solana appears only as a team
   credential. DeCharge's hackathon deck sells "Recurring revenue for investors"; its demo day
   opens on EV charging and traction and leaves crypto as the capital layer at the end. onocoy
   2023 sells the token model; onocoy 2024 opens on the GNSS market, calls the demand side web2
   and names Solana only at the end.
2. **With a crypto audience, the chain steps up.** NATIX 2020 (blockchain as a security detail)
   versus NATIX 2022 (a Helium-like model); Helium 2017 (no "blockchain" at all) versus 2019
   ("you're mining our blockchain"); BlockMesh's deck (settlement) versus its demo day (the token
   lowers acquisition cost).
3. **All three investor Q&As here hit the token-for-supply question:** what contributors get
   beyond earning (NATIX 2022), when incentives get cut (onocoy 2024), what happens if the token
   price falls (Robot Flow Labs). The strongest answers: paying demand outside crypto that buys
   the token through data credits (onocoy, Robot Flow Labs), and "the token is a part of the
   project is not the project". NATIX answered with intrinsic motivation, which landed weaker.
4. **Chain in the background means traceability or settlement.** ZkyProof signs drone data on
   the device and puts only a proof onchain: "The blockchain sees one thing only. Verify equals
   true. A verdict, not the data." It opens on the field problem and sells the funder the onchain
   usage. Also SvachSakthi and GreenKWh ("transparency and traceability"), BlockMesh's deck
   (micropayments, public registry, reputation), NATIX 2020.
5. **Chain leading usually means "earn passive income":** Kiko, WeatherXM, Helium 2019, FOAM.
   That frame is what triggers the question in item 3. Selling a return ("earn passive income",
   "Recurring revenue for investors", "30% high yields", "100% of the yield") is the securities
   red flag of Mistake 4 in [crypto-pitch-mistakes.md](crypto-pitch-mistakes.md): those lines
   come off the slide and go to [crypto-legal-skill](https://github.com/solanabr/crypto-legal-skill).
6. **Sequencing stated as a defense:** Auki says it will build first and launch a token after,
   and that buying the token is not an investment.
7. **A DePIN pitch that never names the chain can win:** Decen Space, first DePIN pick at
   Breakout, only says "rewards".

## Where to find more, and what is closed

- Colosseum's accelerator demo days (Cohorts 1 to 4) are on YouTube with captions; Cohort 5 was
  shown on X.
- Colosseum's public project pages for hackathon entries often link the team's presentation: a
  Google Slides deck that exports without a login, or a video. They are the best source of real
  pre-seed crypto decks.
- Older competitions with investor Q&A are on YouTube: NYC Media Lab 2018, Blockrocket 2020, BFG
  Superstars 2022, Crypto Valley 2024, Next Top Blockchain Startup 2024.
- Closed or not found: no seed deck from a physical-DePIN company with a VC lead is public
  (Helium, Hivemapper, GEODNET, DIMO, NATIX, Spexi, WeatherXM, Silencio); Alliance demo-day
  pitches are not public; a16z CSX is only on X.

Four entries are not raise pitches (Helium 2017 talk, Helium 2019 influencer video, WeatherXM
showcase, Auki AMA) and are kept for the contrast; ZkyProof is a grant pitch, not equity.
